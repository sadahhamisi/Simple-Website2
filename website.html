        <h2>About the School</h2>
        <p>Kabarak University was established in the year 2000 by the 2nd president of Kenya, H.E. the Late Hon. Daniel T. Arap Moi, who was also the founding chancellor. The university was established as a result of his idea of setting up a Christian university that would meet the demand for higher education in Kenya and offer quality education based on strong moral principles. 
            <br></br>
        The vice-chancellor is Professor Henry Kiplagat. The university opened its doors to the new students in September 2002. The institution is building a referral hospital that will host the health sciences school and serve as the referral hospital.
        The university operated under a letter of interim authority granted by the Kenya government. The letter was presented to the university by the Commission for Higher Education of Kenya,[2] on 16 October 2001, allowing the institution to award degrees. On 16 May 2008 the university was awarded its charter by H.E. Mwai Kibaki.
